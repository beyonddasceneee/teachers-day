Today there was TRP Computing PE
I'm kinda glad there was no History
Cuz I don't understand
The content
But I'm sure Ms Lim will explain it to me

What's the point of learning Chinese
When this society speaks English?
But I think I know
That I wouldn't grow so I
Thank wulaoshi who makes it easy

I really hate school but my teachers make it fun (finger snapx4)
So i'd better work hard or else they'll feel done (oh yeah, yeah)

Whoosh
I appreciate, because they create
An environment
For us to learn, so we don't 
Take a wrong turn
Yeah our teachers are great

I used to think Science was tiring
Too hard that sometimes I was crying
Then I met Mr Lee
He's really friendly, so now I
Like Science lessons cuz he's so interesting

Everyday I ponder over what to do
Cuz Math really makes me want to puke
But I remember Mrs Tang
Who pops up with a "bang"!
She teaches us and lets us know how it's useful

And these are just some of the teachers who teach us (finger snapx4)
So I'd better work hard or else they'll feel done (oh yeah, yeah)

Whoosh
I appreciate, because they create
An environment
For us to learn, so we don't 
Taken a wrong turn
Yeah our teachers are-

Whoosh
Sometimes I get tired, feel like I died
But then they
Help us learn, so we don't 
Take a wrong turn
Yeah our teachers are great

Our class really pisses off all the teachers
We're rowdy like a bunch of creatures
So I admire their patience,
Their kindness,
Their compassion,
Their care, 
I hate them, 
I love them, 
And we all go

Whoosh
I appreciate, because they create
An environment
For us to learn, so we don't 
Taken a wrong turn
Yeah our teachers are-

Whoosh
Sometimes I get tired, feel like I died
But then they
Help us learn, so we don't 
Take a wrong turn
Yeah our teachers are great
