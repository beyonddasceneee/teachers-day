I'm kinda glad there was no History
Cuz I don't understand
The content

What's the point of learning Chinese
When this society speaks English?
But I think I know
That I wouldn't grow so I
Thank wulaoshi who makes it easy

I really hate school but my teachers make it fun (finger snapx4)
So i'd better work hard or else they'll feel done (oh yeah, yeah)

Whoosh
I appreciate, because they create
An environment
For us to learn, so we don't 
Take a wrong turn
Yeah our teachers are great

I used to think Science was tiring
Too hard that sometimes I was crying
Then I met Mr Lee
He's really friendly, so now I
Like Science lessons cuz he's so interesting

Everyday I ponder over what to do
Cuz Math really makes me want to puke
But I remember Mrs Tang
Who pops up with a "bang"!
She teaches us and lets us know how it's useful
